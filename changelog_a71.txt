DerpFest v16.0 for Samsung Galaxy A71 4G (a71naxx)
20251110 update

November Update
KernelSU-Next is included in the build.
OTA/Local Update is probably still not working, still no idea why... For now, use adb sideload/sd card from recovery.

Release Notes:
- Included November 2025 security patch!
- Upstreamed kernel!
- Fixed an issue where apps would not stay open in the background.
- Added new customization features, like gradient-color QS and new Pulse visualizers.
- More stuff that doesn't fit in here :)

Special thanks:
- All testers!
- Haky86, Lineage Maintainer, for the original trees I adapted.
- eun0115, for his KernelSU-Next + SuSFS implementation
- The P. A. N. Z. Core Team, y'all are truly the best!
