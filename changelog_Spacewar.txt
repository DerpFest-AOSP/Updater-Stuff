DerpFest v16.0 for Nothing Phone (1) (Spacewar)
20251006 Update

Release Notes:
September Update
KernelSU-Next is included.

New features and bugfixes:
- Integrity now passes strong by default!
- Added back GPhotos Unlimited Storage!
- Added a feature that fixes Google Wallet (requires a non-revoked keybox)
- Notifications now have transparency (optional)!
- Added Flashlight Control!
and much more...

Known bugs:
- I recommend using Google Camera for photos and NOS Camera for videos, which work perfectly after the last hotfix.
- The ringtone doesn't play through bluetooth headsets.
- When using flashlight control, the light turns itself off sometimes. I might decide to exclude it in the future.

Special thanks:
- LineageOS and BrainKub for their trees.
- The P.A.N.Z. core team - guys, you are truly the best!
